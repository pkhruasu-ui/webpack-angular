Webpack-Angular 5 basic
 Very minimal setup to make webpack work with Angular 5 and AOT
 - No other js

** Caveat : Lazy load for Angular **
 - Chunk name can not be used for AOT. Need to find out why(Works for JIT though).

To run
- npm i
- npm serve:aot
- Go to http://localhost:9000/

** build manually instead of using dev-server to decrease file size.
- npm build:aot
- use any server of your choice and point it to dist folder generated by transpiler
